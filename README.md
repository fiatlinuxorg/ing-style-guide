# Ing. Mobile App Style Guide

This repository contains the official style guide and UX guidelines for the "Ing." mobile application, a dating app designed specifically for university students and engineers. The goal of this guide is to ensure that every page and interaction in the app adheres to a consistent design language, providing a seamless and cohesive user experience.

## Why This Style Guide?

As we develop the Ing. app, it’s essential to maintain uniformity across all components and pages, from typography and color schemes to button styles and layouts. This guide will help developers, designers, and product teams align on design decisions, making sure that every feature added fits seamlessly into the existing design framework.

## What’s Included

1. **Colors** - Defines the color palette that should be used throughout the app for primary and secondary actions, backgrounds, text, etc.
2. **Typography** - Outlines the fonts, sizes, and styles to maintain a unified look for headings, body text, buttons, and input fields.
3. **Spacing** - Guidelines for padding, margins, and overall element spacing for a clean and accessible design.
4. **Components** - A library of reusable UI components like buttons, input fields, cards, and modals, each with its design specifications.
5. **UX Guidelines** - Detailed instructions for structuring key user flows and screens like login, home, and profile pages, ensuring consistency in functionality and layout.

## How to Use

- **Developers**: Use this guide as a reference when building new features or modifying existing ones. Stick to the defined components and styles to avoid discrepancies.
- **Designers**: Follow the typography, color schemes, and component designs to ensure visual consistency across the app.
